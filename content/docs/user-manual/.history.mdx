{/* TODO
## long press(/click?) on the back or forward button to see and navigate history of the same tab
## use history sidebar (ctrl + h) and history section in main menu to open previously opened sites
## restore previous windows (include "open previous windows and tabs" option in Settings > General; and then show how to do it via the main menu, as well as keyboard shortcuts)
## restore previous tabs (via main menu, via tab context menu, as well as keyboard shortcuts)
## What if you lose your tabs when opening Zen?
